To whomsoever it may concern,

Pretty much everything has been done as per the rubric. Haven't used solution code as all my previous assignments have near perfect scores.

The SQL script creates all tables, 8 of which using foreign key constraints. Naming is also as per rubric.

The SQLConnection file handles most of the heavy work for this assignment. This file has 4 main functions as follows
	1) PopulateDatabase	
	2) RetrieveDatabase
	3) sortAssignments
	4) sortDeliverables
Please let me know if you have any queries.

Thank you
Hrishi
